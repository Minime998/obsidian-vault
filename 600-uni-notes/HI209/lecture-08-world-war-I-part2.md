# World War I (part 2)

## America in the First World War

### Trench Warfare

Primary theater in war was the western front
- both sides used fortified trenches
- very hard to gain territory
- American troops were welcomed into trenches
	- helped turn the tide with new manpower

### Military Technology

Lots of new tech introduced in the war
- machine guns
- submarines
- armored tanks
- gas
	- all of these advancements made war more deadly
- when the US joined the war they adapted to this tech but were a bit slow to adapt to it

### Tank Warfare

A stalemate developed on the western front due to the trenches
- tanks helped to solve this problem
- developed by allies (most by French)
- The US made no tanks during the war, used French and British tanks
	- after the war this started a new domestic tank industry in the US

### Naval Warfare

most nations started world war I with advanced navies
- the US at the start of the war had a small navy compared to European navies 
- used to protect trade and troop transports from German subs
- US had no subs during the war
	- war helped to start US sub production

### Aerial Warfare

First time planes were used extensively in war
- started out being used for recon.
	- lead to further development of further aircraft to take them down
	- lead to fighters and bombers
	- also lead to synchronized fire (guns were synced up to not hit plane propeller)
- Us made no aircraft during war, relied on allied aircraft
	- lead to US domestic plane production

### Warfare in 1900 and 1918

started out being just men and horses
- warfare had now developed with machine guns, tanks, bombs, and gas
-  compared to Spanish American war, US had much greater combat deaths + causalities
	- still was small compared to 20 million European deaths

### The Turning Tide

US entry helped to start to turn the tide in the allies favor
- US industrial production
- manpower
- US supplies
- Germany had thought that America would take a long tide to gear up to fully fight in war, turned out not to be the case

### America's Contribution to the War Effort

Americans believed that they were going to end the war
- seemed to be Americans were ending the European war in months
	- made Americans more comfortable with further international involvement

## The Wilsonian Moment

### Woodrow Wilson

was a progressive
- was a democrat
- held racist views
- bared African Americans from civil positions
- screened birth of a nation at the white house (story of first klu klux clan)
	- clan "saved" the south according to movie
	- was a fan of the movie
	- helped to make it popular
- also argued the European colonies should become independent (self governing) 
- gained more popularity from the war (also in the international stage)
- looked on as a major post war figure (calm arbiter)
- positions himself and America as a arbiter

### Fourteen Points

1. Open covenants of peace
2. absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas
3. the removal of economic barriers to trade
4. the reduction of national armaments
5. the adjustment of all colonial claims
14. league of nations
(Goal : independent nations that choose to be influenced by America) 
- was well accepted as small nations
- was seen as the protector of smaller nations
- called for peace without victory (peace should not cripple the losers as that would lead to a new war)
	- was ridiculed by leaders for this belief (France, Russia, UK) as they had suffered the most

### Paris Peace Conference

peace with central powers was decided
- how the league of nations would look like
- despite being well liked, his 14 points were ignored
- The Big four decided most things
	- US, Italy, France, UK

### End of War

Germany was seen to have caused it
- decided in treaty of versale

### League of Nations

was one of Wilson's victories
- had little power
- was modeled after US government
- settle disputes before they turned violent
- The US never joined due to the American senate
	- despite not joining they did work with them 

### Wilson's Stroke

Went on barn storming tour to get more support for the league
- seemed to cause stroke
- was hidden and most of his duties were taken over by his wife
	- news did eventually get out
	- questions on how fit for office he was

### US after the War

when the war ended labor unrest started up again
- was very worrying to Americans as many were thinking of the Russian revolution

Red Summer

number of race riots
- white gangs attacking and murdering black people
- more black people moving into the north and getting into factories
- demographics were shifting
	- black Americans wanted to be treated like citizens after their involvement in war
- was a sense that black people were more open to socialism
- lead to rising tensions and violence
- happened in more than a dozen cities
