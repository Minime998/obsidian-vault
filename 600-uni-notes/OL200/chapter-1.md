## Why we communicate

- communication is important for humans

More modern studies have shown that isolation results in them being **anxious**, **restless**, and even start to see **hallucinations**. Prolonged effects included: **anxiety**, high levels of **emotionality**, and trouble completing **cognitive tasks**

Research has even shown people to take **physical torture over isolation**

- research has showed that people that talk about negative experiences are **more satisfied** then those that simple think about it

- more health problems with people that are socially isolated
- children that are isolated: **poor sleep, depression, and poorer overall health**
- adults have: **higher blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, dementia, impaired immune systems, and early death**
- satisfying relationships can be the difference between life and death
