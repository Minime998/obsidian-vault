### How the Self-Concept Develops

**Self Concept** does not exist at birth
- at about six-seven months is when children begin to form the concept of "self"
	- stare at parts of body to make that connection
- as the child develops their sense of identity expands to form a more complicated picture of the self-concept of adults
- this is almost totally due to social interaction
- two models explaine how interaction shape the self, **reflected appraisal** and **social comparison**
