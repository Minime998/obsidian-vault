### How the Self-Concept Develops

**Self Concept** does not exist at birth
- at about six-seven months is when children begin to form the concept of "self"
	- stare at parts of body to make that connection
- as the child develops their sense of identity expands to form a more complicated picture of the self-concept of adults
- this is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">almost totally due to social interaction</mark> 
- two models explain how interaction shape the self, **reflected appraisal** and **social comparison** 

#### Reflected Appraisal  

**Self Concept** can be seen in part as a product of the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">messages you get throughout your life</mark> 
- these messages can be *negative or positive*
- the term **significant other** describes a person whose evaluation/messages were especially influential to that development
	- an example is messages from parents
	- parents that send supportive messages are more likely to raise children with a healthy self concept
- significant others can also be family members as well as teachers and friends can also influence this
-  when something like *"I think you worked hard to solve that problem"* is said to a child, they understand that working hard produced a good result and are therefore more likely to show tenacity and perseverance when faced with a problem
- when something simple like "You're smart" is said to a child it makes them more likely to develop a **fixed mindset** as they believe that someone is simply born smart and that it is not something that can be developed or trained over time
- a fixed mindset means that you are more likely to quit are failing something, less likely to take chances, and tackle difficult projects aka *they live up to expectations*

### Transactional Communication Model

similar to the Linear model, but with key differences
- **Communicators** both send and receive messages at the same time, this takes care of one of the problems of the linear model
- in this model communication is seen as a **reciprocal** event
- the intent in any communication is to build *shared sustained meaning*, this can only be done if all members cooperate and participate
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">each message sent builds on the previous ones</mark> 
	-   this is important as each message sent will impact future ones as well as reinterpretation of past ones
- all communication occurs in **context** (or environment) and context must be considered when sending or receiving messages
	- when context is correctly considered it can reduce **noise**
- an example is if someone uses the word "sick", if they are coughing and talking about he they are feeling it most likely means they are referring to the illness, if they say it in conjunction with seeing someone throw something that means that it really means "cool"

#### Types on context

- **Physical context**
	- the actual environment like in a room or out on the street
	- this would include factors like size and noise present
		- the difference in physical context will likely have a major impact on a message
- **Cultural context**
	- each culture will have different rules for communication
- **Social and emotional context**
	- the relationship with the sender and receiver
- **Historical context**
	- relation of communicators as well as past messages
