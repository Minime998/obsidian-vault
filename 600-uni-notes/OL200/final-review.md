### How the Self-Concept Develops

**Self Concept** does not exist at birth
- at about six-seven months is when children begin to form the concept of "self"
	- stare at parts of body to make that connection
- as the child develops their sense of identity expands to form a more complicated picture of the self-concept of adults
- this is almost totally due to social interaction
- two models explain how interaction shape the self, **reflected appraisal** and **social comparison** 

#### Reflected Appraisal

**Self Concept** can be seen in part as a product of the messages you get throughout your life
- these messages can be negative or positive
- the term **significant other** describes a person whose evaluation/messages were especially influential to that development
	- an example is messages from parents
	- parents that send supportive messages are more likely to raise children with a healthy self concept
- significant others can also be family members as well as teachers and friends can also inflence this
