# Arguments and Validity
## Summary
[[#Arguments]]
- [[#Conclusion Indicators]]

### Arguments
An *argument* is a series of statements consisting of premises and a conclusion
- The conclusion is meant to follow from the argument's premises
Often, in English the conclusion will come after the premises. But, this need not always be the case.
- Dumbo is an elephant. All elephants are bigger than a breadbox. <Mark>Therefore</Mark>, Dumbo is bigger than a breadbox
But we could have said:
- Dumbo is bigger than a breadbox. After all, Dumbo is an elephant, and all elephants are bigger than a bread box

#### Conclusion Indicators
Notice, in the first way of putting our argument about Dumbo, the conclusion was signaled by the work "therefore".
- Words like *so, hence, therefore* often signal a conclusion
- these are conclusion indicator words.
