### Validity in virtue of form


| Example 1: *(valid)*                                                                                                                                                   | Example 2:  *(valid)*                                                                                                      |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist .<br>If Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist,<br>then Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy.<br>Therefore, Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy. | Either the stock market will rise or unemployment will go up.<br>The market will not rise. So,<br>unemployment will go up. |


Each of these arguments is valid, and the validity of them follows from their logical form. 


| logical form 1                       | logical form 2                     |
|:------------------------------------ |:---------------------------------- |
| A.<br>If A, then D.<br>Therefore, D. | Either R or U.<br>Not R.<br>So, U. |

We'll first look at arguments that are formally valid by virtue of their **truth-functional structure**.

<center>
	We'll break each English sentence down into the smallest units that can be T or F, <i>atomic sentences</i>
</center>
<center>	
	- Assign each atomic sentence a sentence letter: A,B,P,Q,Q^2 
</center>

| atomic 1                     | atomic 2                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A<br>A-->D<br>$\therefore$ D | R v U<br> $\neg$R<br>$\therefore$ U |

### Symbolization Key

A **symbolization key** pairs sentence letters with the basic English sentences they represent.

*A*: Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist.
*D*: Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy.
* the sentence letters should stand in for simple sentence units.
* where possible, we want to bring out logical form, so we'll treat "Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist and a banker" like:

*A* Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist
*B* Jenny is a banker
