### Validity in virtue of form


| Example 1: *(valid)* | Example 2:  *(valid)* | 
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
|Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist .<br> If Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist, <br>then Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy. <br>  Therefore, Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy. | Either the stock market will rise or unemployment will go up. <br> The market will not rise. So, <br>   unemployment will go up. |          


Each of these arguments is valid, and the validity of them follows from their logical form.
