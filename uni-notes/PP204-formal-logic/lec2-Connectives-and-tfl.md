### Validity in virtue of form

Example 1: *(valid)* | Example 2:  *(valid)*
Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist .	                  
If Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist, then Dipan
is an avid reader of Tolstoy.
Therefore, Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy. 


Example 2:  *(valid)*
Either the stock market will rise or unemployment
will go up. The market will not rise. So,
unemployment will go up.

Each of these arguments is valid, and the validity of them follows from their logical form.
