## Instance Variables vs Local Variables:

The main difference between them is that a **instance variable** is a variable that is declared in a class but outside a method, while a **local variable** is declared within a **method** or a **constructor** 

## Class definition:

A **class** is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are made. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general **class declarations** can include the following:
- Modifiers: A class can be public or private
- class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class
- class name: The name should begin with an capitalized letter
- Interfaces(if any)
- Body
