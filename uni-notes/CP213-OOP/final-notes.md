### Lesson 6:

An *array* is a data structure used to process a collection of data that is all of the **same type**. It behaves like a numbered list of variables with a uniform naming system. It has a part that  **does not change**: the name, and a part that **does change**: an integer in square bracket.

**Arrays** possess two features: all of its **elements are of the same type** and its elements are **adjacent** in the memory

An array that behaves like a collection of variables can be made using the following (double used here):
```java
double[] score = new double[5];
```
