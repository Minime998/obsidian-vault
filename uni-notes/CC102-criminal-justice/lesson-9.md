# Lesson 9: Alternatives to incarceration 

## **Diversion**
- Refers to any program, procedure, or practice that partly or entirely deals with criminal activity outside of the formal criminal justice system.
- Mostly designed for young offenders
- Can still be used for adults 
- Ontario courts have developed programs for the mentally ill
- Can be implemented during the *(a) police pre-arrest diversion*, *(b) pre-charge diversion*, or *(c) courtroom diversion programs*
- Goals:
	- To keep offenders from being processed further into the formal justice system
	- To reduce costs
	- To reduce social stigma
	- To assist offenders in addressing factors related to offending

### **Labeling Theory**
- focuses on the impact of labels on individuals and how stigma that results can limit prosocial integration and opportunities
- Two types of social interaction:
	- *Stigmatizing shame*:
		- The focus is on the labeling of the individual as deviant, not the act, wherein deviant status becomes master status
	- *Reintegrative Shaming*:
		- Involves community disapproval of an act, not the individual, wherein stigma is reduced and the individual is encouraged to rejoin society.
	
	# **Probation**
	- Refers to a sentence imposed on an offender by a criminal court judge that provides for the supervision of the offender in the community by a probation officer, either is an alternative to incarceration or in conjunction with a period of incarceration
	- Is mandatory for those that have served a conditional discharge, suspended sentence, or an intermittent sentence
		- *Conditional Discharge*:
			- Todd is given a conditional discharge by his sentencing judge and receives a mandatory period of probation
		-*Suspended Sentence*:
			- Sir Alfred receives a suspended sentence with a mandatory period of incarceration from the sentencing judge
		-*Intermittent Sentence*:
			-Brenda is given an intermittent sentence of 60 days she will serve her jail time on weekends and when she is in the community during the week she will follow the conditions of a probation order.
