# Lesson 5: Police Strategies and Operations

## Introduction
- **Carding** is when the police do random stops and ask voluntary questions which response info is entered into the police database to help fight crime. People say however that it is used to target poor black people and is thus a form of racial profiling.

## Models of Policing
- **The Professional Model of Policing** is a model of police work that is reactive, incident-driven, and centered on random patrols. Under this model police will randomly patrol neighborhoods as it is rationally thought that this will deter crime. Under this model response is driven by calls for service.
	- **Incident-driven patrol** is one major characteristic of the model. The idea behind this is that the role of police is primarily to respond for public calls for help. In this model police will patrol the streets and wait for emergency calls or suspicious activity.
