# Overview Of Policing in Canada
## Summary

### History of Policing in Canada

Crime control was based on the principle of **hue and cry**, a requirement that all able-bodied men were expected to assist with maintaining order in a community. early policing took the form of organized community groups. One early example was where men as young as 15 were organized into groups of ten families called **tythings**. In each family was a **tythingman** who was in charge with keeping order. 

In the 1700s, a man known as Henry Fielding, a justice of the peace, established the first modern version of a police force in England known as the **Bow Street Runners**. This group turned out to be ineffective for policing by the turn of the industrial revolution and a man known as Sir Robert Peel established the first *full* time police force with the **Peel's Metropolitan Police Act** (1829).

In Canada early attempts at policing first started in Quebec in the 1600s and grew from their to other major settlements. The **North West Mounted Police**(NWMP) was established in 1873 with the purpose of controlling the vast expansive western areas in Canada and had a paramilitary structure. In 1920 they were renamed to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

### Structure of Policing in Canada

Policing in Canada is provided in many ways and can be confusing when first looking at them. At the federal level, police services are provided by the RCMP under the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act**, a piece of federal legislation that provides the framework for the operation of the RCMP. In addition to being  a federal law enforcement agency, the RCMP provides 

**contract policing**, which refers to an arrangement where RCMP officers provide provincial and municipal level policing services. Policing services are also provided at the provincial level. The three are (1) the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), (2) the Surete du Quebec, and (3) the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. these forces are responsible for law enforcement in rural areas as well as doing contract policing for certain municipalities. 

A **regional police service** is a growing trend in Canada and is where a police force is developed through a combining of several smaller independent organizations. They can provide services to a larger area and greater number of residents at a reduced cost, but on the other hand they can result in a highly centralized law enforcement thereby reducing the ability of the police to engage in more community-oriented police practices. 

**Municipal Police Services** provide policing inside a city's boundaries. enforcing the criminal code, provincial statutes, municipal bylaws, and some federal statutes such as the controlled Drugs and Substances Act. First nations can also have their own police force. their is also an observed increase in private policing.
