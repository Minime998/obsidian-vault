## Summary

### History of Policing in Canada

Crime control was based on the principle of **hue and cry**, a requirement that all able-bodied men were expected to assist with maintaining order in a community. early policing took the form of organized community groups. One early example was where men as young as 15 were organized into groups of ten families called **tythings**. In each family was a **tythingman** who was in charge with keeping order. 

In the 1700s, a man known as Henry Fielding, a justice of the peace, established the first modern version of a police force in England known as the **Bow Street Runners**. This group turned out to be ineffective for policing by the turn of the industrial revolution and a man known as Sir Robert Peel established the first *full* time police force with the **Peel's Metropolitan Police Act** (1829).

In Canada early attempts at policing first started in Quebec in the 1600s and grew from their to other major settlements.
