### Summary

[[#2 1 Decimal Numbering System]]

#### 2.1 Decimal Numbering System

The decimal numbering system has 10 digits 0-9

The decimal numbering system has a base of 10 with each position weighted by a factor of 10

...10^5, 10^4..10^0, 10^-1..

14.2 = 1 X 10^1 +4 X 10^0 + 2 X 10^-1

#### 2.2 Binary Numbers

The binary number system has 2 digits 0 and 1

The binary numbering system has a base of 2 with each position weighted by a factor of 2

...2^5...2^0...2^-2

10111 = 1 X 2^4 + 0 X 2^3 + 1 X 2^3 + 1 X 2^0

The largest decimal number = 2^n-1

**Example**: n=4
2^n - 1 = 2^4 - 1 = 15

##### Binary-to-decimal Conversion

**Example**: convert binary 0.1011 to decimal
- **Solution**: Determine the weight of each bit that is a 1, and then sum the weights to get the decimal fraction

Weight: 2^-1 2^-2 2^-3 2^-4
Binary number: 0 . 1 0 1 1

0.1011 = 2^-1 - 2^-3 - 2^-4 = 0.5
