## Half adder
- output dependent on the two inputs that are being added
	- Single bit #'s
	- It does not take carry from previous sum
	- A+B = S (exclusive or)
	- A+B = Co (And)

## Full Adder
- output dependent on two inputs and carry input
- Single but #'s
- A + B + Ci = S
- Co = AB + Ci(A+B)exclusive
