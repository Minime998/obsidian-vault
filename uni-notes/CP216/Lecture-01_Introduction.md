## 1.1 What is Computer Systems Architecture?

The **CPU** is connected by a **bus** to the **Cache memory** and the **System bus**. The System bus is connected by other buses to the **Main memory** and the **Expansion bus interface**. The Expansion interface goes to the **Expansion bus** (by another bus) to the ** I/O** , **Disk Drive**, **Display controller**, and the **Serial interface controller**

The design of computers is affected by things like current tech, performance, applications, the OS, and power consumption.
