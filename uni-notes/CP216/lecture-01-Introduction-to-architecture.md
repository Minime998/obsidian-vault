### 1.1 What is Computer Systems Architecture?

The **CPU** is connected by a **bus** to the **Cache memory** and the **System bus**. The System bus is connected by other buses to the **Main memory** and the **Expansion bus interface**. The Expansion interface goes to the **Expansion bus** (by another bus) to the ** I/O** , **Disk Drive**, **Display controller**, and the **Serial interface controller**

The design of computers is affected by things like current tech, performance, applications, the OS, and power consumption.

*This course will focus on the CPU (ARM architecture)*

The main focus is how the CPU will communicate to the Memory using a bus. The Memory itself is partitioned into different blocks. The CPU will read the instructions from the memory and then carried out operations on input data from the Memory. Data and Instructions co-exist in the same Memory system (see partitions).

Data is used in the memory as instructions to go to the interpreter which is regulated by a clock. The interpreter then sends the instructions to the Control signal generator which signals to different parts of the computer. Software controls the hardware.

### 1.2 Architecture and Organization

Factors affecting the computer designer:
Tech, Architecture, System, Applications, etc...

### 1.3 Development of Computers

- Abacus
- Analytical Engine
- Analog Computer
- 1904
- Atanasoff-Berry Computer
- ENIAC
- Transistors
- Transistor effect
- transistor computers

### 1.4 The Stored Program Computer

Program code is written and then compiled into a line by line instructions made out of 32 bits. (or 64 depending on the System)

IF logic is the foundation of most logic (IF Then Else)

### 1.5 The stored Program Concept

Memory gives location that is then connected to Data. (but Memory itself has no meaning on its own)
