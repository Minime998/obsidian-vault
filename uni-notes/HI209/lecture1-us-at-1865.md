*Westward expansion* was occurring, but a look of the mid west states where not states yet

*Native American* removal was occurring was a policy to replace them with white settlers
- large numbers of bison where killed to undermine food supply and put them in reservations
Attempt at the time to assimilate First Nations (**cultural genocide**)
- White culture as forward and civilized, First Nations backward
- Later frustration shifted to a dying race, not as capable as white people
- culture would die out in schools

*Slavery* had developed due to economic reason (**mainly in the south**)
- Idea grew of racial hierarchy, white man was higher up, developed by slavery economic system
- Slavery started to **fade out in the North** but was still profitable as southern products from slavery are sold to the north a *symbiosis of North and South* 
* Slavery started to become a **Moral** issue
