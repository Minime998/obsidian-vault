Truth Tables

#### Propositions
A *proposition* is a declarative sentence that is either true or false
Examples of *Propositions*:

	a) The Moon is made of green cheese.
	b) Toronto is the capital of Canada
	c) Blue jays always win
	d) 0+0=2
Examples that are not *Propositions*:

	a) Sit down!
	b) What time is it?
	c) he might be in a bad mood.

##### Propositional Logic and Compound Propositions
* Propositional variables: we use *p,q,r,s...* to represent a proposition
* Any Proposition can have one of two truth values, true denoted by T and false denoted by F
* Compound Propositions; constructed from logical connectives and other propositions
	* Negation $\neg$
	* Conjunction $\wedge$
	* Disjunction $\vee$
	* Implication $\rightarrow$
	* Biconditional $\leftrightarrow$

#### Compound Propositions: Negation
The *negation* of a proposition *p* is denoted by 
$\neg$*p* and has the truth table:

**Example**: if *p* denotes "The Earth is round.", then $\neg$*p* denotes "It is not the case that the Earth is round" or more simply "The Earth is not round"

#### Compound Propositions: Conjunction
The *conjunction* of propositions *p* and *q* is denoted by *p $\wedge$ q* and has the truth table:

[![](CaptureDis_Conjunction.png)](CaptureDis_Conjunction.png)

**Example**: if *p* denotes "I am at home." and *q* denotes "It is raining." then *p $\wedge$ q* denotes "I am at home, and it is raining."

#### Compound Propositions: Disjunction
The *disjunction* of propositions *p* and *q* is denoted by *p $\vee$ q* and has the truth table:

[![](CaptureDis_Disjunction.png)](CaptureDis_Disjunction.png)

**Example**: if *p* denotes "I am at home." and *q* denotes "It is raining." then *p $\vee$ q* denotes "I am at home or it is raining." 

##### The Connective Or in English
In English "or" has two distinct meanings. Inclusive or or exclusive or
* "Inclusive Or" - [[#Compound Propositions Disjunction]]
* "Exclusive Or" - [![](CaptureDis_Xor.png)](CaptureDis_Xor.png)

#### Compound Propositions: Implication 
If *p* and *q* are propositions, then *p $\rightarrow$ q* is a *conditional statement* or *implication* which is read as "if *p*, then *q*" and has the following truth table:

**Example**: if *p* denotes "I am at home." and *q* denotes "it is raining." then *p $\rightarrow$ q* denotes "If I am at home then it is raining."
