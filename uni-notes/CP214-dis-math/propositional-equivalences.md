#### Tautologies, Contradictions, and Contingencies

A *tautology* is a proposition which is always true.
* Example: *p* $\vee$ $\neg$*p*

A *contradiction* is a proposition which is always false.
* Example: *p* $\wedge$ $\neg$*p*

A *contingency* is a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction, such as *p*

#### Logically Equivalent

Two compound propositions *p* and *q* are logically equivalent if *q* $\leftrightarrow$ *q* is a tautology

We write this as *p* $\leftrightarrow$ *q* or as p $\equiv$ *q* where *p* and *q* are compound propositions.
