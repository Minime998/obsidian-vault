Steps to convert an English sentence to a statement in propositional logic
- identify atomic (simple) propositions and represent using propositional variables
- determine appropriate logical connectives

>"If I go to Harry's or to the country, then I will not go shopping."

* *p*: I go to Harry's
* *q*: I go to the country.
* *r*: I will go shopping.

If *p* or *q*, then not *r*.

(*p* $\vee$ *q*) $\rightarrow$ $\neg$*r*

>"You can access the internet from campus only if you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman."

Let *a*, *c*, and *f* represent respectively
*a* $\rightarrow$ (*c* $\vee$ $\neg$*f*)
