### Summary

#### Proofs of Mathematical Statements

A ***proof*** is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a statement.
In math, CS, and other subjects, informal proofs which are for the most part shorter, are somewhat used.
- More than one rule of inference are often used in a step.
- Steps may be skipped. Easier for to understand and to explain to people.
- But it is also easier to introduce errors.
