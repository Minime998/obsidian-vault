## Proposition
- A *proposition* is a declarative sentence that is either true or false
>Examples:
>a) The Moon is made of green cheese
>b) Toronto is the capital of Canada
>c) Blue jays always win
>
>Examples that are not:
>a) Sit down!

### Proposition Logic
- In propositional logic **Propositional variables** like *p*,*q*,*r*,*s* are used to represent a proposition
- Any proposition can be either *T* or *F*
- A more advanced form of logic is **Compound Propositions** which are constructed from combining propositions using symbols like:
	- **Negation** $\neg$
	- **Conjunction** $\wedge$
	- **Disjunction** $\vee$
	- **Implication** $\rightarrow$
	- **Biconditional** $\leftrightarrow$
	
## Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse
>Example: Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of "It raining is a sufficient condition for my not going to town."

Solution:
- **converse**: If I do not go to town, then it is raining. *(flipped)*
- **inverse**: If it is not raining, then I will go to town. *(negative meaning)*
- **contrapositive**: If I go to town, then it is not raining. *(negative + flipped)*

## Equivalent Propositions
- Two propositions can be called *equivalent* if they always have the same truth value.

## Consistent System Specifications
- A system of propositions is *consistent* if there is a combination that makes all of them true
