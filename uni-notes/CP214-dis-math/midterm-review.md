### Proposition Logic
- In propositional logic **Propositional variables** like *p*,*q*,*r*,*s* are used to represent a proposition
- Any proposition can be either *T* or *F*
- A more advanced form of logic is **Compound Propositions** which are constructed from combining propositions using symbols like:
	- **Negation** $\neg$
	- **Conjunction** $\wedge$
	- **Disjunction** $\vee$
	- **Implication** $\rightarrow$
	- **Biconditional** $\leftrightarrow$
	
	## Negation
	- the *negation* of a proposition like *p* is denoted by $\neg$*p* and has the following truth table:
