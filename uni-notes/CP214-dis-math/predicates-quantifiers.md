### Summary
[[#Propositional Logic Not Enough]]

#### Propositional Logic Not Enough

If we have:
- "All men are mortal."
- "Socrates is a man."

Does it follow that "Socrates is mortal?"

Can't be represented in propositional logic. Need a language that talks about objects, their properties, and their relations.

Later we'll see how to draw inferences

#### Propositional Functions

Propositional functions become propositions (and have truth values) when their variables are each replaced by a value from the *domain* (or *bound* by a quantifier, as we will see later).

The statement *P(x)* is said to be the value of the propositional function *P* at *x*.

For example, let P(x) denote "x > 0" and the domain be the integers. Then:
- P(-3) is false.
- P(0) is false
- P(3) is true.

Often the domain is denoted by *U*. So in this example *U* is the integers
