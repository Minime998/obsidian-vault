## Sets

Sets are on of the basic building blocks for the types of objects considered in discrete mathematics.
- important for counting 
- programming languages have set operations

Set theory is an important branch of mathematics
- many different systems of **axioms** have been used to develop set theory
- here we are not concerned with a formal set of axioms for set theory. Instead, we will use what is called **naive set theory** 

A *Set* is an unordered collection of well defined objects.
- the students in the class
- the chairs in this room
The **objects** in a set are called the *elements* or *members* of the set. A set is said to *contain* its elements.

The notation *a* $\in$ *A*
